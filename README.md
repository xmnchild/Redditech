# Creating a Redditech clone using React Native

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f6cbfdeba3664f959484e5e852fd04f3)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/xmnchild/Redditech?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=xmnchild/Redditech&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

The aim of this project was to create a Reddit mobile application that would have the same features (almost) as the real one. We used React Native to develop a cross-platform application.
